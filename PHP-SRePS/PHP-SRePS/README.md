Status: Incomplete, Under Development

Developed with HTML5, CSS3, javascript, Angular.js, AJAX/JSON, PHP & SQL.

##### Notes: 
- SQL syntax is design for use with MySQL & MariaDB
- 'settings.php' lists the connection details for the DB.  You need to modify the password in this, with your DB password
- PHP Unit Tests requires installation of PHPUnit framework
- Internet Explorer 8 (and earlier) don't support HTML5
- Database Unit Testing assumes the database is empty/clear before running.
- Testing Framework assumes your either running PHP 5.3, 5.4, 5.5 or 5.6

##### Tested in: 
- Firefox 48.0
- Chrome 51.0.2
- Internet Explorer 11.0.9600
